[Stewart Platforms](https://raw.org/research/inverse-kinematics-of-a-stewart-platform/) are used for motion platforms with six dimensions of freedom.

Written entirely by *GPT-5*, "index.html" uses the "p5.min.js" and "stewart.js" libraries to simulate and control a rotary actuated Stewart platform in browser. 


*This project provides an interactive web-based interface for exploring and controlling a simulated Stewart Platform. It combines a 3D canvas renderer (via p5.js and WebGL) with rich control panels that let you:*

*- Adjust the mechanical parameters of the platform (rod length, horn length, base and platform radii, servo ranges, etc.).*

*- Switch between multiple motion patterns (wobble, tilt, rotate, ping-pong ball balancing, helical sweep, etc.) or take direct control via         keyboard/gamepad inputs.*

*- Visualize servo angles, joint positions, and safety states in real time, with built-in inverse kinematics validation to ensure feasible poses.*

*- Render servo markers and motion tracers so you can see how the platform moves in 3D space.*

*In short, it’s not just for sending positional inputs — it’s an educational and debugging tool that helps you design, test, and visualize Stewart platform behaviors interactively before applying them to hardware.*
